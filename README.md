# NgPlanets

Small webapp to show planets and their details

## Improvements

- [x] Styles architecture
- [ ] Lazy loaded feature module with Page/components architecture
- [ ] Master detail routing - Master should always be beneath, and detail route should shown above, with back buttom to existing master view
- [ ] Optimize images ?
